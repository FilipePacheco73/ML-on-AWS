## Summary

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my machine learning upskilling journey with AWS. This repository features a collection of projects and code samples demonstrating the use of various AWS tools and services, including Amazon S3, EC2, and the Amazon SageMaker suite (GroundTruth, Canvas, Data Wrangler, JumpStart, Studio, AutoGluon, etc.).

This repository is the result of the Udemy course *AWS SageMaker Machine Learning Engineer in 30 Days + ChatGPT*. The course is aimed at individuals who want to master AWS machine learning techniques and build production-level ML applications. Machine Learning is transforming industries like finance, healthcare, and technology, and AWS is a leading platform in this space. The course covers everything from the basics to advanced techniques for building, training, and deploying ML models efficiently using AWS SageMaker and other AWS services.

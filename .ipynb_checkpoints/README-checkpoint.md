## Summary

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my machine learning upskilling journey with AWS. Throughout this repository, you'll find a collection of code and projects showcasing my development using various AWS tools and services. These tools include Amazon S3 Bucket, EC2 instances, and the powerful Amazon SageMaker suite, encompassing Ground Truth, Canvas, Data Wrangler, JumpStart, and Studio, to name a few. Join me on this learning journey as I explore and leverage AWS for machine learning.

## Installation

For installation details and library dependencies, please refer to the individual notebooks within this repository or consult the specific runtime libraries available in the SageMaker Studio environment.

## Data-Usage

All data necessary for running the code can be found conveniently in the same root directory as the associated notebooks and scripts. Feel free to explore and utilize these datasets in your own machine learning experiments. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
